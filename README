Assignment 1

The first assignment gives you the opportunity to develop OSGi a service provider and a 
service consumer.

1. The Service Provider implements a hotel booking system and defines services 
	such as: check-in/out, room availability for a small hotel with five rooms.
2. The Service Consumer must have a well-defined GUI, so that the user could 
	easily use the services from the provider.

Part 1 (35 marks) – The service provider
Part 2 (65 marks) – The service consumer

The assignment should be presented as a web page that contains:

TEAM Members: Student Names, Emails
1. ReadMe.txt link to files that explains your solution.
2. Source files link including: XML files, Java files and other 
	resourses that you developed for your assignment.
3. Run it: a description on how to run in Eclipse the OSGi app.

Your assignment will be delivered as an email. The email must be sent on the due date to:
jordan.anastasiade@senecac.on.ca

 The subject line must be
	<YourLastName-TEAM Number>_ECL: Assignment1
	(one of the team member will send the email)
 Your email content must be:
	http://ecl500_113axx:ppp@zenit.senecac.on.ca/~ecl500_113axx
		where xx is your account number and ppp is your password

This solution will be evaluated based upon:
 Correctness of the solution
	A very important consideration must be given to the GUI design: 
	look & feel of the complete and correct functionality.
